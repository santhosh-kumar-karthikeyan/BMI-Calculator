# Project Title

A BMI calculating app that gets the height and weight of a person and displays the BMI with an opinion on that BMI.


## Features

- Gets your height as input ðŸ¤¯
- Gets your weight as input (no judging here)
- Violate the second point ( we do a lotta judging )
- Calculates your BMI ( no bs, no clickbait ðŸ’¯)


## Roadmap

- To add a sarcastic roast from an AI API

- To actually acquire more data and possibly provide a diet routine and a constructive criticism to get them better

- To publish the app into a store probably itch.io ( isn't it for games tho, probably should develop a game instead)
